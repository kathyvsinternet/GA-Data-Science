# GA-Data-Science
General Assembly | Data Science, part-time course

### My Final Project
The major project I worked on in this course was a data collection and visualization project around Harvey Weinstein's network of abusers. My initial idea was to map out all of the film connections of prominent members of Hollywood who have perpetrated sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, and domestic violence. I imagined the end result to be a giant network graph showing something like six-degrees-of-separation from every abuser to the next.

I learned the hard way that the data collection alone could take days upon days to run and I simply did not have the time to work at that scale. So, I pared down the project to focus on Weinstein himself and asked, how many people did he have single film connections to? In the last day of class, I was able to present this [abridged project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qhDgreFELRZSZsV5om24hEQSUzR3LeAgNWRmdPydBBQ/edit?usp=sharing).

The primary skills I used were working with APIs, data analysis, and visualization using Neo4j.
